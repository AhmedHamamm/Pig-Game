## Game Rules 📜

1. The game has 2 players, playing in turns.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their **current score**.
3. **BUT** if the player rolls a `1`, their current score gets reset to `0`. After that, it's the next player's turn.
4. The player can choose to **Hold** their score, which adds their current score to their **global score**. After that, it's the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach **100 points** on the global score wins the game.
